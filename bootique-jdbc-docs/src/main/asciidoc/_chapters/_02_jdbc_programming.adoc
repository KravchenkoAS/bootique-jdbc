[#jdbc-configuration]
== Programming with "bootique-jdbc"

To work with Ð° database you need an instance of `javax.sql.DataSource`. `bootique-jdbc` provides a way to configure
one or more named DataSource in the app. Here is a minimal configuration example using HikariCP format. Full
reference for both Tomcat and HikariCP configuration is provided in <<jdbc-configuration-ref,this chapter>>. (And don't
forget that you can print full configuration docs for your version of Bootique by running your app with `-H` flag).

Once you have a named DataSource configured, you can inject a `io.bootique.jdbc.DataSourceFactory` and access configured
DataSources by name:
